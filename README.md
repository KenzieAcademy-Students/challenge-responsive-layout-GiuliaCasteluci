# Kenzie Academy Challenge: Responsive Layout

Follow the instructions provided on `my.kenzie.academy` for this challenge. The `style1.css` and `style2.css` files and the `src` folder are placeholders. Feel free to rename it or add additional files to the project. You are allowed to change any of the files **except the HTML file**. If you would like to use some JavaScript, you are more than welcome to, but it isn't necessary.

Customize this README.md however you want to turn it into documentation for your project (including deleting these opening paragraphs). The only required sections are the **Project Plan** and **Reflection** below. Be sure to use proper Markdown syntax in this file (here's a [cheatsheet PDF](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) of the basic syntax).

## Project Plan (Advanced Level Only)

For this assignment i just used the dev tools and messed around following the instructions.
## Reflection (All Levels)

Why is it important that a website works well on a broad range of browsers and screen sizes?

Because the website will be opened by different people in different screens, such as iphone, samsung, computer, notbook, they all have diffrent screen sizes. We must make sure everyone can open our websites

 
As front-end developers, how do we make sure that pages work equally well across a variety of browsers and screen size?

HTML is fundamentally responsive, or fluid. If you create a web page containing only HTML, with no CSS, and resize the window, the browser will automatically reflow the text to fit the viewport. Other than that, we can use media queries. Media queries allow you to apply CSS styles depending on a device's general type (such as print vs. screen) or other characteristics such as screen resolution or browser viewport width. You can test and monitor media states using the Window.matchMedia() and MediaQueryList.addListener() JavaScript methods.
